# Cat Tower Defense
This is a small tower defense game that is based on cats as towers. 

## Visit the game on:
[CatTD](https://cattd.moritzmeissgeier.de) (thanks to Finn for the hosting)

## How CatTD works
CatTD is working fully on the client side. This means, that the leaderboard is not publically available and only for local purposes. 
The game itself is working with a canvas and is drawn by JS.
The login system and a Java Backend can be added soon.

## Testing and using code
The game is working with cookie storage, for testing, open it on a local live server or try it with the [link](https://cattd.moritzmeissgeier.de) provided above.
Do **not** try to start the game as a file, this won't work properly.
