# Cat Tower Defense
This is a small tower defense game that is based on cats as towers. 

## Visit the game on:
[CatTD](https://cattd.finanzberg.online) (thanks to Finn for the hosting)

## How CatTD works
CatTD is working fully on the client side, so is the leaderboard just a local one.
The game itself is working with a canvas and is drawn by JS.
The login system and a Java Backend will come soon.

## Testing and using code
The game is working with cookie storage, for testing, open it on a local live server or try it with the link provided above.
Do **not** try to start the game as a file, this won't work properly.
